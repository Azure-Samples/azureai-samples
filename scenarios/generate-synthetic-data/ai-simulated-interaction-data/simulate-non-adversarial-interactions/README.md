## General-purpose interaction simulation

Generate multiple interaction data samples at one time with user-provided list of tasks or profiles to create an target dataset to evaluate your generative AI applications.

We provide the basic prompt templates needed for the system large language model to simulate different scenarios with your target

| Task type          | Template name   |
|--------------------|-----------------|
