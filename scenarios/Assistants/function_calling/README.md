## Assistants function calling with Bing Search

### Overview

In this notebook, we'll show how you can use the [Bing Search APIs](https://www.microsoft.com/bing/apis/llm) and [function calling](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/function-calling?tabs=python) to ground Azure OpenAI models on data from the web. This is a great way to give the model access to up to date data from the web.

This sample will be useful to developers and for data scientists who want to learn about function calling capabilities and search based grounding.
