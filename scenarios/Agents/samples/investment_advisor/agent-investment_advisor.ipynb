    "The scenario utilizes an AI Agent integrated with two powerful tools: Function Calling and Code Interpreter. These tools work together to retrieve stock prices and calculate portfolio metrics, replicating real-world workflows in investment management.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. *Upload Investment Data*: Import a CSV file containing the user’s investment portfolio into the OpenAI Project.\n",
    "2. *Fetch Real-Time Stock Prices*: Use the Yahoo! Finance API via *Function Calling* to retrieve up-to-date closing stock data.\n",
    "3. *Perform Portfolio Analysis*: Leverage *Code Interpreter* to compute key portfolio metrics and insights.\n",
    "4. *Create Data Visualations*: Leverage *Code Interpreter* to generate portfolio visualization, and leverage Python libraries to render image."
