    "In this scenario, we analyze sales data for AdventureWorks using Azure OpenAI. The AI agent performs tasks such as file retrieval, sales calculations, and generating insights by leveraging tools like File Search. This showcases how businesses can employ Azure OpenAI Agents to streamline analytical workflows and decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *File Conversion*: Converting Excel data into a Markdown format compatible with the AI agent.\n",
    "2. *File Upload*: Storing the converted files in the Azure OpenAI Project for efficient processing.\n",
    "3. *AI-Powered Analysis*: Leveraging Azure OpenAI to generate insights such as revenue metrics by region.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on demonstration will prepare you to use Azure OpenAI Assistants for similar real-world data engineering and analytics tasks."
