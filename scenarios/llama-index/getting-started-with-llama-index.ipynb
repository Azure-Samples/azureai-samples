    "    1. You can use [GitHub models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) endpoint including the free tier experience.\n",
    "    2. Use the endpoint `https://models.inference.ai.azure.com` along with your GitHub Token.\n",

    "1. Using Azure AI Foundry:\n",

    "    1. Create an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com).\n",

    "Models deployed to Azure AI studio or Azure Machine Learning can be used with `llama-index` in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using the Azure AI model inference API:** All models deployed to Azure AI studio and Azure Machine Learning support the Azure AI model inference API, which offers a common set of functionalities that can be used for most of the models in the catalog. The benefit of this API is that, since it's the same for all the models, changing from one to another is as simple as changing the model deployment being use. No further changes are required in the code. When working with `llama-index`, install the extensions `llama-index-llms-azure-inference` and `llama-index-embeddings-azure-inference`.\n",
    "- **Using the model's provider specific API:** Some models, like OpenAI, Cohere, or Mistral, offer their own set of APIs and extensions for `llama-index`. Those extensions may include specific functionalities that the model support and hence are suitable if you want to exploit them. When working with `llama-index`, install the extension specific for the model you want to use, like `llama-index-llms-openai` or `llama-index-llms-cohere`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are working with the Azure AI model inference API, hence we install the following packages:\n",
