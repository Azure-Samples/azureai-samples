    "# AI Red Teaming Agent for Generative AI models and applications in Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This notebook walks through how to use Azure AI Evaluation's AI Red Teaming Agent functionality to assess the safety and resilience of AI systems against adversarial prompt attacks. AI Red Teaming Agent leverages [Risk and Safety Evaluations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in?tabs=warning#risk-and-safety-evaluators) to help identify potential safety issues across different risk categories (violence, hate/unfairness, sexual content, self-harm) combined with attack strategies of varying complexity levels from [PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT), Microsoft AI Red Teaming team's open framework for automated AI red teaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "You should expect to spend about 30-45 minutes running this notebook. Execution time will vary based on the number of risk categories, attack strategies, and complexity levels you choose to evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "First, deploy the Azure AI Red Teaming infrastructure using the deployment script in the `infra/` folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Navigate to the AI_RedTeaming directory\n",
    "cd scenarios/evaluate/AI_RedTeaming\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the deployment script\n",
    ".\\infra\\deploy.ps1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create an Azure AI Foundry hub and project with all necessary resources including GPT-4o model deployment. The deployment script will output environment variables that you need to copy to a `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: In order to upload your results to Azure AI Foundry, you must have the `Storage Blob Data Contributor` role (automatically assigned by the deployment script).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: Ensure that you've installed the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and authenticated using `az login` before running the deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "From a terminal window, navigate to your working directory which contains this sample notebook, and execute the following.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv .venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, activate the virtual environment created:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# source .venv/bin/activate # If using Mac/Linux OS\n",
    ".venv/Scripts/activate # If using Windows OS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With your virtual environment activated, install the following packages required to execute this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install uv\n",
    "uv pip install azure-ai-evaluation[redteam] azure-identity openai python-dotenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment Setup\n",
    "After deployment, create a `.env` file in this directory and copy the environment variables from the deployment output. A sample file is provided at `.env.sample`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now open VSCode with the following command, and ensure your virtual environment is used as kernel to run the remainder of this notebook.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "code .\n",
