    "# AI Red Teaming Agent for Generative AI models and applications in Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This notebook walks through how to use Azure AI Evaluation's AI Red Teaming Agent functionality to assess the safety and resilience of AI systems against adversarial prompt attacks. AI Red Teaming Agent leverages [Risk and Safety Evaluations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in?tabs=warning#risk-and-safety-evaluators) to help identify potential safety issues across different risk categories (violence, hate/unfairness, sexual content, self-harm) combined with attack strategies of varying complexity levels from [PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT), Microsoft AI Red Teaming team's open framework for automated AI red teaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "You should expect to spend about 30-45 minutes running this notebook. Execution time will vary based on the number of risk categories, attack strategies, and complexity levels you choose to evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "First, if you have an Azure subscription, create an [Azure AI hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/ai-resources) then [create an Azure AI project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/ai-resources). AI projects and Hubs can be served within a private network and are compatible with private endpoints. You **do not** need to provide your own LLM deployment as the AI Red Teaming Agent hosts adversarial models for both simulation and evaluation of harmful content and connects to it via your Azure AI project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Role**: Ensure that you have the [Azure AI User](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/rbac-azure-ai-foundry#azure-ai-user) role assigned for your Azure subscription. This role provides the necessary permissions to run AI red teaming scans and access Azure AI Foundry services.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to upload your results to Azure AI Foundry:\n",
    "- Your AI Foundry project must have a connection (*Connected Resources*) to a storage account with `Microsoft Entra ID` authentication enabled.\n",
    "- Your AI Foundry project must have the `Storage Blob Data Contributor` role in the storage account.\n",
    "- You must have the `Storage Blob Data Contributor` role in the storage account.\n",
    "- You must have network access to the storage account.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/run-scans-ai-red-teaming-agent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: First, ensure that you've installed the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and then make sure to authenticate to Azure using `az login` in your terminal before running this notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Confirm you ran `az login` in the active shell and that the account has the **Azure AI User** role plus the storage `Storage Blob Data Contributor` assignments called out earlier in this notebook. These roles are required to create evaluation runs and upload artifacts.\n",
    "- When working inside a secured hub, make sure the connected storage account is accessible from your network and that Entra ID authentication is enabled on the storage resource.\n",
    "- If the cloud red teaming helper prints `This may be due to missing environment variables or insufficient permissions.`, double-check the `AZURE_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`, `AGENT_NAME`, and storage role assignments before retrying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyRIT \"Error sending prompt\" message\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Exception: Error sending prompt with conversation ID: <guid>` indicates PyRIT could not reach the target LLM during a conversation turn. The runner retries the same conversation up to the configured limit, so isolated occurrences are expected and usually recover without intervention.\n",
    "- Common triggers are transient network issues, 429 throttling, or 5xx responses from the target deployment. Even if retries succeed you will still see the stack trace in the notebook output.\n",
    "- Inspect the `redteam.log` file emitted to the scan output directory (for local runs this defaults to `<working dir>/runs/<scan_id>/redteam.log`) for the original exception and HTTP status. Increase verbosity with `PF_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG` when deeper diagnostics are needed.\n",
    "- If one conversation ID keeps failing, verify the target credentials, check deployment health, and review Azure OpenAI quota/rate-limit alerts in the Azure portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target resource not found\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you pass an Azure OpenAI deployment directly as the `target` to `RedTeam`, set `azure_endpoint` to `https://<hub>.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/<deployment_name>/chat/completions?api-version=2025-01-01-preview`.\n",
    "- If you instantiate `AzureOpenAI`, use the resource-level endpoint format `https://<hub>.openai.azure.com/`. Ensure the deployment name and API version match an active deployment in the selected hub.\n",
    "- If the cloud run fails with `Error code: 404 - {'error': {'code': '404', 'message': 'Resource not found'}}` while creating the eval group, confirm you have `azure-ai-projects>=2.0.0b1` installed (the preview APIs surface only in that version or later).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this comprehensive notebook, we've demonstrated the full spectrum of Azure AI Evaluation SDK's `RedTeam` functionality to assess the safety and resilience of AI systems across multiple dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complete Risk Category Coverage**: We explored all available risk categories, including both standard categories (Violence, HateUnfairness, Sexual, SelfHarm, ProtectedMaterial, CodeVulnerability, UngroundedAttributes) and cloud-only categories (ProhibitedActions, SensitiveDataLeakage, TaskAdherence)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advanced Attack Strategies**: We demonstrated sophisticated attack techniques including:\n",
    "   - Single-turn encoding and obfuscation attacks\n",
    "   - Multi-turn conversational attacks\n",
    "   - **Crescendo attacks** - gradually escalating conversations from benign to harmful\n",
    "   - Composed attack strategies that layer multiple techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cloud Red Teaming**: We showed how to leverage the Azure AI Projects SDK for cloud-based red teaming that provides access to additional risk categories and evaluation capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Custom Attack Objectives**: We demonstrated how to use custom prompts for targeted testing scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Automated Scheduling**: We mirrored the preview `sample_scheduled_evaluations.py` flow to register recurring agent safety evaluations directly from Azure AI Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "The automated AI red teaming scans provide valuable insights into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overall Attack Success Rate (ASR)** - The percentage of attacks that successfully elicit harmful content\n",
    "2. **Vulnerability by Risk Category** - Which types of harmful content your model is most vulnerable to  \n",
    "3. **Effectiveness of Attack Strategies** - Which attack techniques are most successful against your model\n",
    "4. **Multi-Turn Attack Patterns** - How sophisticated conversational attacks like Crescendo can gradually bypass safety measures\n",
    "5. **Cloud vs Local Capabilities** - Additional risk categories and evaluation depth available through Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Crescendo and MultiTurn attacks** require significantly more time and resources than single-turn attacks\n",
    "- **Cloud-only agent safety risk categories** (ProhibitedActions, SensitiveDataLeakage, TaskAdherence) are only available when targetting an agent using cloud Red Teaming\n",
    "- **Multi-turn attacks** provide deeper insights but require longer execution times and higher API costs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mitigation**: Use these results to strengthen your model's guardrails against identified attack vectors, paying special attention to multi-turn attack patterns\n",
    "2. **Continuous Testing**: Implement regular red team evaluations as part of your development lifecycle, including both fast single-turn and thorough multi-turn testing\n",
    "3. **Cloud Integration**: Consider leveraging Azure AI Foundry for access to additional risk categories and cloud-scale evaluation capabilities\n",
    "4. **Custom Strategies**: Develop custom attack strategies and objectives for your specific use cases and domain\n",
    "5. **Safety Layers**: Implement multiple layers of defense including Azure AI Content Safety, custom content filters, and conversation flow controls\n",
    "6. **Monitoring**: Set up continuous monitoring for attack patterns in production, especially sophisticated multi-turn attempts \n",
    "7. **Schedule Health Checks**: Review the scheduled run history and alerts so unattended evaluations keep delivering fresh coverage without manual intervention"
