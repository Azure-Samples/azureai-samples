    "> - Appropriate roles and credentials: ensure your user or service principal has access to the Azure AI Project (and any linked resources like storage and Azure OpenAI).

    "\n",
    "Selecting the right model is the first step in any AI solution. Azure AI Foundry provides a **Model Catalog** in its portal that lists hundreds of models across providers (Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta, Hugging Face, etc.). In this section, we'll see how to find and select models via:\n",

    "- **Azure SDK (Python)** ü§ñ (programmatic approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç Browsing Models in Azure AI Foundry Portal \n",
    "In the Azure AI Foundry portal, navigate to **Model catalog**. You can:\n",
    "1. **Search or filter** models by provider, capability, or use-case (e.g., *Curated by Azure AI*, *Azure OpenAI*, *Hugging Face* filters).\n",
    "2. Click on a model tile to view details like description, input/output formats, and usage guidelines.\n",
    "3. **Deploy** the model to your project or use it directly if it‚Äôs a hosted service (for Azure OpenAI models, ensure you have them deployed in your Azure OpenAI resource).\n",
    "\n",
    "> üí° **Tip:** Models from Azure OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4, Ada) need an Azure OpenAI deployment. Other models (like open models from Hugging Face) can be deployed on managed endpoints in Foundry. Always check if a model requires deployment or is immediately usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ü§ñ Listing Models via SDK\n",

Use Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard as a guide (Identify potential harms, Measure them, Mitigate with tools like content filters, and Plan for ongoing Operation).\n",
    "- **Access control**: Use Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can deploy or invoke models. Separate development, testing, and production with proper approvals.\n",
    "- **Data governance**: Ensure no sensitive data is used in prompts or stored in logs. Anonymize or avoid personal data. Use Content Safety and ProtectedMaterial evaluators to catch leaks.\n",
    "- **Continuous monitoring**: Leverage telemetry and evaluation metrics in production. For example, track the rate of content safety flags or low groundedness scores over time, and set up alerts if they spike.\n",
    "- **Feedback loops**: Allow users to report bad answers. Periodically retrain or adjust prompts based on real-world usage and known failure cases.\n",
    "- **Documentation and transparency**: Document how the model should and should not be used. Provide disclaimers about limitations. This aligns with transparency in Responsible AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "> üéâ By following these practices ‚Äì selecting the right model, rigorously evaluating for safety, security, and quality, and monitoring in production ‚Äì you can build AI solutions that are not only powerful but also trustworthy and compliant. Happy building! üéØ"
