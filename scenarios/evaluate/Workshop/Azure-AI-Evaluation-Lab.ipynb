    "# Azure AI Evaluation Capabilities Exploration Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this interactive notebook! 🎉 Here, we will explore how to evaluate and improve Azure AI generative models in terms of **safety**, **security**, and **quality**, with robust **observability** and governance practices. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Prerequisites:** Before running the notebook, make sure you have:\n",
    "> - An Azure subscription with access to Azure AI Foundry and an **Azure AI Project** created.\n",
    "> - Appropriate roles and credentials: ensure your user or service principal has access to the Azure AI Project (and any linked resources like storage and Azure OpenAI). You will also need the following roles: *Azure AI Developer* role in Azure AI Foundry and *Storage Blob Data Contributor* on the project’s storage.\n",
    "> - Azure CLI installed and logged in (`az login`), or otherwise configure `DefaultAzureCredential` with your Azure account.\n",
    "> - The required Azure SDK packages installed (we'll install them below). \n",
    "> - Your Azure AI Project connection information: either a **project connection string** or the subscription ID, resource group, and project name for the Azure AI Project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by installing the necessary SDKs:\n"

    "## 1. Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the right model is the first step in any AI solution. Azure AI Foundry provides a **Model Catalog** in its portal that lists hundreds of models across providers (Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta, Hugging Face, etc.). In this section, we'll see how to find and select models via:\n",
    "- **Azure AI Foundry Portal** 🎨 (visual interface)\n",
    "- **Azure SDK (Python)** 🤖 (programmatic approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Browsing Models in Azure AI Foundry Portal \n",
    "In the Azure AI Foundry portal, navigate to **Model catalog**. You can:\n",
    "1. **Search or filter** models by provider, capability, or use-case (e.g., *Curated by Azure AI*, *Azure OpenAI*, *Hugging Face* filters).\n",
    "2. Click on a model tile to view details like description, input/output formats, and usage guidelines.\n",
    "3. **Deploy** the model to your project or use it directly if it’s a hosted service (for Azure OpenAI models, ensure you have them deployed in your Azure OpenAI resource).\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Tip:** Models from Azure OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4, Ada) need an Azure OpenAI deployment. Other models (like open models from Hugging Face) can be deployed on managed endpoints in Foundry. Always check if a model requires deployment or is immediately usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤖 Listing Models via SDK\n",
    "Using the Azure AI Projects SDK (`azure-ai-projects`), we can programmatically retrieve available models in our project. This helps ensure our code is using the correct model names and deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, connect to your Azure AI Project using the **connection string** or project details:\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Fallbacks**: If an evaluator or content filter detects a likely jailbreak attempt in user input, you can refuse or safely handle that request.\n",

    "Implementing **Responsible AI** goes beyond just code – it requires policies and continuous oversight:\n",
    "- **Responsible AI principles**: Align with fairness, reliability & safety, privacy, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. Use Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard as a guide (Identify potential harms, Measure them, Mitigate with tools like content filters, and Plan for ongoing Operation).\n",
    "- **Access control**: Use Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can deploy or invoke models. Separate development, testing, and production with proper approvals.\n",
    "- **Data governance**: Ensure no sensitive data is used in prompts or stored in logs. Anonymize or avoid personal data. Use Content Safety and ProtectedMaterial evaluators to catch leaks.\n",
    "- **Continuous monitoring**: Leverage telemetry and evaluation metrics in production. For example, track the rate of content safety flags or low groundedness scores over time, and set up alerts if they spike.\n",
    "- **Feedback loops**: Allow users to report bad answers. Periodically retrain or adjust prompts based on real-world usage and known failure cases.\n",
    "- **Documentation and transparency**: Document how the model should and should not be used. Provide disclaimers about limitations. This aligns with transparency in Responsible AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎉 By following these practices – selecting the right model, rigorously evaluating for safety, security, and quality, and monitoring in production – you can build AI solutions that are not only powerful but also trustworthy and compliant. Happy building! 🎯"
