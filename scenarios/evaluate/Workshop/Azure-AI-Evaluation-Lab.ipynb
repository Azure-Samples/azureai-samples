    "\n",
    "Welcome to this interactive notebook! üéâ Here, we will explore how to evaluate and improve Azure AI generative models in terms of **safety**, **security**, and **quality**, with robust **observability** and governance practices. \n",

    "> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Prerequisites:** Before running the notebook, make sure you have:\n",
    "> - An Azure subscription with access to Azure AI Foundry and an **Azure AI Project** created.\n",
    "> - Appropriate roles and credentials: ensure your user or service principal has access to the Azure AI Project (and any linked resources like storage and Azure OpenAI). You will also need the following roles: *Azure AI Developer* role in Azure AI Foundry and *Storage Blob Data Contributor* on the project‚Äôs storage.\n",
    "> - Azure CLI installed and logged in (`az login`), or otherwise configure `DefaultAzureCredential` with your Azure account.\n",
    "> - The required Azure SDK packages installed (we'll install them below). \n",
    "> - Your Azure AI Project connection information: either a **project connection string** or the subscription ID, resource group, and project name for the Azure AI Project.\n",

    "## 1. Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the right model is the first step in any AI solution. Azure AI Foundry provides a **Model Catalog** in its portal that lists hundreds of models across providers (Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta, Hugging Face, etc.). In this section, we'll see how to find and select models via:\n",
    "- **Azure AI Foundry Portal** üé® (visual interface)\n",
    "- **Azure SDK (Python)** ü§ñ (programmatic approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç Browsing Models in Azure AI Foundry Portal \n",
    "In the Azure AI Foundry portal, navigate to **Model catalog**. You can:\n",
    "1. **Search or filter** models by provider, capability, or use-case (e.g., *Curated by Azure AI*, *Azure OpenAI*, *Hugging Face* filters).\n",
    "2. Click on a model tile to view details like description, input/output formats, and usage guidelines.\n",
    "3. **Deploy** the model to your project or use it directly if it‚Äôs a hosted service (for Azure OpenAI models, ensure you have them deployed in your Azure OpenAI resource).\n",
    "\n",
    "> üí° **Tip:** Models from Azure OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4, Ada) need an Azure OpenAI deployment. Other models (like open models from Hugging Face) can be deployed on managed endpoints in Foundry. Always check if a model requires deployment or is immediately usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ü§ñ Listing Models via SDK\n",
    "Using the Azure AI Projects SDK (`azure-ai-projects`), we can programmatically retrieve available models in our project. This helps ensure our code is using the correct model names and deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, connect to your Azure AI Project using the **connection string** or project details:\n",

    "In the above simulation:\n",
    "- We used `ADVERSARIAL_REWRITE` as the scenario, which tests if attackers can manipulate the model into generating harmful content. The simulator tried 2 attack patterns.\n",
    "- Our Azure AI Agent service provided defense-in-depth with built-in safety controls:\n",
    "  - Content filtering and input validation\n",
    "  - Secure thread-based conversation management\n",
    "  - Proper system prompts and instructions\n",
    "- The warnings (\"Error: 'str' object has no attribute 'role'\") show the simulator testing different attack vectors:\n",
    "  - Direct attacks (UPIA): Explicit attempts to bypass controls\n",
    "  - Indirect attacks (XPIA): Hidden malicious prompts\n",
    "- Following best practices, we properly cleaned up the agent after testing\n",

    "\n",
    "Even if content is safe and secure, we must ensure the model's **answers are high-quality**: correct, relevant, well-structured, and helpful. Azure AI Evaluation provides a variety of built-in metrics and the ability to perform **cloud evaluation** on your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll demonstrate how to **evaluate your dataset remotely in the cloud** (sometimes called a *single-instance cloud evaluation*), rather than just local calls to an evaluator. This approach is convenient when you have a set of query-response pairs (or other multi-turn data) from your AI application that you‚Äôd like to systematically evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Setting up the Cloud Evaluation\n",
    "We'll use the following steps:\n",
    "1. **Upload or reference the dataset** (the query-response pairs) that you want to evaluate.\n",
    "2. **Configure** the cloud evaluators you want to run (e.g., `RelevanceEvaluator`, `F1ScoreEvaluator`, `ViolenceEvaluator`, etc.).\n",
    "3. **Create** an `Evaluation` object in Azure AI Projects referencing your dataset and chosen evaluators.\n",
    "4. **Monitor** the evaluation job status. Then fetch results once it is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** This approach allows for pre-deployment or post-deployment QA checks on your model's responses and can incorporate safety checks, correctness checks, or custom metrics.\n"

Use Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard as a guide (Identify potential harms, Measure them, Mitigate with tools like content filters, and Plan for ongoing Operation).\n",
    "- **Access control**: Use Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can deploy or invoke models. Separate development, testing, and production with proper approvals.\n",
    "- **Data governance**: Ensure no sensitive data is used in prompts or stored in logs. Anonymize or avoid personal data. Use Content Safety and ProtectedMaterial evaluators to catch leaks.\n",
    "- **Continuous monitoring**: Leverage telemetry and evaluation metrics in production. For example, track the rate of content safety flags or low groundedness scores over time, and set up alerts if they spike.\n",
    "- **Feedback loops**: Allow users to report bad answers. Periodically retrain or adjust prompts based on real-world usage and known failure cases.\n",
    "- **Indirect Attack Evaluation**: Additionally, simulate indirect attack jailbreaks by injecting malicious context or altering user queries to test the resilience of the RAG pipeline. This helps identify vulnerabilities that can lead to unexpected behavior or information leakage.\n",
    "- **Documentation and transparency**: Document how the model should and should not be used. Provide disclaimers about limitations. This aligns with transparency in Responsible AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "> üéâ By following these practices ‚Äì selecting the right model, rigorously evaluating for safety, security, and quality, and monitoring in production ‚Äì you can build AI solutions that are not only powerful but also trustworthy and compliant. Happy building! üéØ"

    "### 6. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Evaluation (Local)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we demonstrate a **basic RAG** flow using the Azure AI Projects SDK along with Azure AI Search. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where an LLM leverages external data‚Äîretrieved via vector or hybrid search‚Äîto ground its responses, thereby reducing hallucinations and improving answer relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> üì¶ **Note:** Make sure to install the Azure AI Search package:\n",
    "> ```bash\n",
    "> pip install azure-search-documents\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might store a set of AI safety guidelines and best practices in a search index, and then, upon receiving a user query about security or responsible AI, retrieve the most relevant documents. These documents are passed as context to the LLM to generate a final, informed answer grounded in established practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this notebook demonstrates how indirect attack jailbreaks can occur in the RAG pipeline by injecting malicious context or modifying user queries. Such adversarial manipulations can lead to altered or unexpected behaviors, and are simulated using our indirect attack adversarial framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluators for RAG\n",
    "When evaluating RAG systems, the following evaluators are particularly relevant:\n",
    "- **RelevanceEvaluator**: Assesses if the retrieved documents are relevant to the query.\n",
    "- **CoherenceEvaluator**: Checks if the final generated response is coherent with the provided context.\n",
    "- **GroundednessEvaluator**: Evaluates how well the response is anchored in the retrieved information.\n",
    "- **FluencyEvaluator** and **BleuScoreEvaluator**: Help assess the linguistic quality of the generated output.\n",
    "\n",
    "These evaluators provide insights into the effectiveness of both the retrieval and generation stages of your RAG pipeline. For AI safety content, it's particularly important to ensure high groundedness scores to maintain the accuracy of security and governance recommendations."
