    "Welcome to this interactive notebook! 🎉 Here, we will explore how to evaluate and improve Azure AI generative models in terms of **safety**, **security**, and **quality**, with robust **observability** and governance practices. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Prerequisites:** Before running the notebook, make sure you have:\n",
    "> - An Azure subscription with access to Azure AI Foundry and an **Azure AI Project** created.\n",
    "> - Appropriate roles and credentials: ensure your user or service principal has access to the Azure AI Project (and any linked resources like storage and Azure OpenAI). You will also need the following roles: *Azure AI Developer* role in Azure AI Foundry and *Storage Blob Data Contributor* on the project’s storage.\n",
    "> - Azure CLI installed and logged in (`az login`), or otherwise configure `DefaultAzureCredential` with your Azure account.\n",
    "> - The required Azure SDK packages installed (we'll install them below). \n",
    "> - Your Azure AI Project connection information: either a **project connection string** or the subscription ID, resource group, and project name for the Azure AI Project.\n",

    "\n",
    "Selecting the right model is the first step in any AI solution. Azure AI Foundry provides a **Model Catalog** in its portal that lists hundreds of models across providers (Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta, Hugging Face, etc.). In this section, we'll see how to find and select models via:\n",

    "- **Azure SDK (Python)** 🤖 (programmatic approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Browsing Models in Azure AI Foundry Portal \n",
    "In the Azure AI Foundry portal, navigate to **Model catalog**. You can:\n",
    "1. **Search or filter** models by provider, capability, or use-case (e.g., *Curated by Azure AI*, *Azure OpenAI*, *Hugging Face* filters).\n",
    "2. Click on a model tile to view details like description, input/output formats, and usage guidelines.\n",
    "3. **Deploy** the model to your project or use it directly if it’s a hosted service (for Azure OpenAI models, ensure you have them deployed in your Azure OpenAI resource).\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Tip:** Models from Azure OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4, Ada) need an Azure OpenAI deployment. Other models (like open models from Hugging Face) can be deployed on managed endpoints in Foundry. Always check if a model requires deployment or is immediately usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤖 Listing Models via SDK\n",

    "### 📏 Governance Best Practices\n",
    "Implementing **Responsible AI** goes beyond just code – it requires policies and continuous oversight:\n",
    "- **Responsible AI principles**: Align with fairness, reliability & safety, privacy, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. Use Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard as a guide (Identify potential harms, Measure them, Mitigate with tools like content filters, and Plan for ongoing Operation).\n",
    "- **Access control**: Use Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can deploy or invoke models. Separate development, testing, and production with proper approvals.\n",
    "- **Data governance**: Ensure no sensitive data is used in prompts or stored in logs. Anonymize or avoid personal data. Use Content Safety and ProtectedMaterial evaluators to catch leaks.\n",
    "- **Continuous monitoring**: Leverage telemetry and evaluation metrics in production. For example, track the rate of content safety flags or low groundedness scores over time, and set up alerts if they spike.\n",
    "- **Feedback loops**: Allow users to report bad answers. Periodically retrain or adjust prompts based on real-world usage and known failure cases.\n",
    "- **Documentation and transparency**: Document how the model should and should not be used. Provide disclaimers about limitations. This aligns with transparency in Responsible AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎉 By following these practices – selecting the right model, rigorously evaluating for safety, security, and quality, and monitoring in production – you can build AI solutions that are not only powerful but also trustworthy and compliant. Happy building! 🎯"
