    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to evaluate data generated by AI applications or LLMs remotely in the cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the following Azure AI services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Azure AI Safety Evaluation](https://aka.ms/azureaistudiosafetyeval)\n",
    "- [azure-ai-evaluation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/evaluate-sdk)\n",

    "## Time\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect to spend 20 minutes running this sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "## About this example\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates the cloud evaluation of query and response pairs that were generated by an AI app or a LLM. It is important to have access to AzureOpenAI credentials and an AzureAI project. **To create data to use in your own evaluation, learn more [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/simulator-interaction-data)** . This example demonstrates: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Single-instance, triggered cloud evaluation on a test dataset (to be used for pre-deployment evaluation of an AI application).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "### Prerequesite\n",
    "- Have an Azure OpenAI Deployment with GPT model supporting `chat completion`, for example `gpt-4`.\n",
    "- Make sure you're first logged into your Azure subscription by running `az login`.\n",
    "- You have some test data you want to evaluate, which includes the user queries and responses (and perhaps context, or ground truth) from your AI applications. See [data requirements for our built-in evaluators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/evaluate-sdk#data-requirements-for-built-in-evaluators). Alternatively, if you want to simulate data against your application endpoints using Azure AI Evaluation SDK, see our samples on simulation. \n",
