    "# Intent Resolution Evaluator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This sample demonstrates to how to use intent resolution evaluator on agent data. The supported input formats include:\n",
    "- simple data such as strings;\n",
    "- user-agent conversations in the form of list of agent messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect to spend about 20 minutes running this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "For quality evaluation, you need to deploy a `gpt` model supporting JSON mode. We recommend a model `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4o-mini` for their strong reasoning capabilities.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install azure-ai-projects azure-identity azure-ai-evaluation\n",
    "```\n",
    "Set these environment variables with your own values:\n",
    "1) **PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING** - The project connection string, as found in the overview page of your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "2) **MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME** - The deployment name of the model for this AI-assisted evaluator, as found under the \"Name\" column in the \"Models + endpoints\" tab in your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "3) **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT** - Azure Open AI Endpoint to be used for evaluation.\n",
    "4) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY** - Azure Open AI Key to be used for evaluation.\n",
    "5) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION** - Azure Open AI Api version to be used for evaluation.\n",
    "6) **AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID** - Azure Subscription Id of Azure AI Project\n",
    "7) **PROJECT_NAME** - Azure AI Project Name\n",
    "8) **RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME** - Azure AI Project Resource Group Name\n"

    "The Intent Resolution evaluator measures how well an agent has identified and resolved the user intent.\n",
    "The scoring is on a 1-5 integer scale and is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Score 1: Response completely unrelated to user intent\n",
    "  - Score 2: Response minimally relates to user intent\n",
    "  - Score 3: Response partially addresses the user intent but lacks complete details\n",
    "  - Score 4: Response addresses the user intent with moderate accuracy but has minor inaccuracies or omissions\n",
    "  - Score 5: Response directly addresses the user intent and fully resolves it\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation requires the following inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Query    : The user query. Either a string with a user request or a list of messages with previous requests from the user and responses from the assistant, potentially including a system message.\n",
    "  - Response : The response to be evaluated. Either a string or a message with the response from the agent to the last user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a third optional parameter:\n",
    "  - ToolDefinitions : The list of tool definitions the agent can call. This may be useful for the evaluator to better assess if the right tool was called to resolve a given intent."
