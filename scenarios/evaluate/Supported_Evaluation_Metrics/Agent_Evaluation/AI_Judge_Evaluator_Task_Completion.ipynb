    "# Task Completion Evaluator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This sample demonstrates how to use task completion evaluator on agent data. The supported input formats include:\n",
    "- simple data such as strings and `dict` describing task responses;\n",
    "- user-agent conversations in the form of list of agent messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect to spend about 20 minutes running this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "For quality evaluation, you need to deploy a `gpt` model supporting JSON mode. We recommend using `gpt-4.1` or `gpt-4.1-mini`.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install azure-ai-projects azure-identity openai\n",
    "```\n",
    "Set these environment variables with your own values:\n",
    "1) **AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT** - Your Azure AI project endpoint in format: `https://<account_name>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project_name>`\n",
    "2) **AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME** - The deployment name of the model for this AI-assisted evaluator (e.g., gpt-4o-mini)"
