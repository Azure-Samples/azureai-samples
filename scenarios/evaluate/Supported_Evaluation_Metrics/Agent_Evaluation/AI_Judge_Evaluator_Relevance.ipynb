    "# Relevance Evaluator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This sample demonstrates how to use the Relevance evaluator to assess the relevance of AI-generated responses. The evaluator supports multiple input formats including:\n",
    "- Simple query and response pairs\n",
    "- Multi-turn conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect to spend about 15 minutes running this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "For quality evaluation, you need to deploy a `gpt` model supporting JSON mode. We recommend a model `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4o-mini` for their strong reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install azure-ai-evaluation\n",
    "```\n",
    "Set these environment variables with your own values:\n",
    "1) **MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME** - The deployment name of the model for this AI-assisted evaluator\n",
    "2) **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT** - Azure OpenAI Endpoint to be used for evaluation\n",
    "3) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY** - Azure OpenAI Key to be used for evaluation\n",
    "4) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION** - Azure OpenAI API version to be used for evaluation\n"

    "## What is Relevance?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Relevance evaluator assesses the ability of AI responses to capture the key points and address the user's query appropriately. It measures how well the response relates to and answers the specific question or request.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring:** Relevance scores range from 1 to 5, with:\n",
    "- **1**: Completely irrelevant to the query\n",
    "- **2**: Partially relevant but misses key points\n",
    "- **3**: Moderately relevant with some key points addressed\n",
    "- **4**: Highly relevant with most key points covered\n",
    "- **5**: Perfectly relevant, fully addressing the query\n",
    "\n",
    "High relevance scores indicate the AI system's understanding of the input and capability to produce contextually appropriate outputs."
