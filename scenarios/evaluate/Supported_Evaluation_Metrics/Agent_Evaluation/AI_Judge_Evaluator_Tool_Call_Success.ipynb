    "# Tool Call Success Evaluator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This sample demonstrates how to use tool call success evaluator on agent data. The supported input formats include:\n",
    "- simple data such as strings and `dict` describing agent responses;\n",
    "- user-agent conversations in the form of list of agent messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect to spend about 20 minutes running this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "For quality evaluation, you need to deploy a `gpt` model supporting JSON mode. We recommend a model `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4o-mini` for their strong reasoning capabilities.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install azure-ai-projects azure-identity azure-ai-evaluation\n",
    "```\n",
    "Set these environment variables with your own values:\n",
    "1) **AZURE_AI_PROJECT** - The project connection string, as found in the overview page of your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "2) **MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME** - The deployment name of the model for this AI-assisted evaluator, as found under the \"Name\" column in the \"Models + endpoints\" tab in your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "3) **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT** - Azure Open AI Endpoint to be used for evaluation.\n",
    "4) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY** - Azure Open AI Key to be used for evaluation.\n",
    "5) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION** - Azure Open AI Api version to be used for evaluation.\n"

    "This evaluator focuses solely on tool call results and tool definitions, disregarding user's query to the agent, conversation history and agent's final response. Although tool definitions is optional, providing them can help the evaluator better understand the context of the tool calls made by the agent. Please note that this evaluator validates tool calls for potential technical failures like errors, exceptions, timeouts and empty results (only in cases where empty results could indicate a failure). It does not assess the correctness or the tool result itself, like mathematical errors and unrealistic field values like name=\"668656\".\n",
