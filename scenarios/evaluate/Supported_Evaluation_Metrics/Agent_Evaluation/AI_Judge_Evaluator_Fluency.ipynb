    "## Objective\n",
    "This sample demonstrates how to use the Fluency evaluator to assess the linguistic quality of AI-generated responses. The evaluator measures how well generated text conforms to grammatical rules, syntactic structures, and appropriate vocabulary usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect to spend about 20 minutes running this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "For quality evaluation, you need to deploy a `gpt` model supporting JSON mode. We recommend a model `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4o-mini` for their strong reasoning capabilities.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install azure-ai-projects azure-identity azure-ai-evaluation\n",
    "```\n",
    "Set these environment variables with your own values:\n",
    "1) **AZURE_AI_PROJECT** - The project connection string, as found in the overview page of your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "2) **MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME** - The deployment name of the model for this AI-assisted evaluator, as found under the \"Name\" column in the \"Models + endpoints\" tab in your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "3) **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT** - Azure Open AI Endpoint to be used for evaluation.\n",
    "4) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY** - Azure Open AI Key to be used for evaluation.\n",
    "5) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION** - Azure Open AI Api version to be used for evaluation."
