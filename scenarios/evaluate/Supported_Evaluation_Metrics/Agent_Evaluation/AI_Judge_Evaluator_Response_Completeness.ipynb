    "This sample demonstrates how to use Response Completeness Evaluator on agent's response when ground truth is provided. This evaluator is helpful when you have ground truth to assess the quality of the agent's final response. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect to spend about 20 minutes running this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "For quality evaluation, you need to deploy a `gpt` model supporting JSON mode. We recommend a model `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4o-mini` for their strong reasoning capabilities.    \n",

    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install azure-ai-evaluation\n",
    "```\n",
    "Set these environment variables with your own values:\n",
    "1) **MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME** - The deployment name of the model for this AI-assisted evaluator, as found under the \"Name\" column in the \"Models + endpoints\" tab in your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "2) **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT** - Azure Open AI Endpoint to be used for evaluation.\n",
    "3) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY** - Azure Open AI Key to be used for evaluation.\n",

    "Score 2: Barely complete: The response contains only a small percentage of the necessary information.\n",
