    "# Groundedness Evaluator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This sample demonstrates how to use the Groundedness evaluator to assess whether AI-generated responses are grounded in the provided context. The evaluator supports multiple input formats including:\n",
    "- Simple response and context evaluation\n",
    "- Query, response, and context evaluation\n",
    "- Agent responses with tool calls (file_search)\n",
    "- Multi-turn conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses consistent examples with the ToolCallAccuracyEvaluator for better comparison across evaluators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect to spend about 20 minutes running this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "For quality evaluation, you need to deploy a `gpt` model supporting JSON mode. We recommend using `gpt-4o`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install azure-ai-projects azure-identity openai\n",
    "```\n",
    "Set these environment variables with your own values:\n",
    "1) **AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT** - Your Azure AI project endpoint in format: `https://<account_name>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project_name>`\n",
    "2) **AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME** - The deployment name of the model for this AI-assisted evaluator (e.g., gpt-4o-mini)"

    "## What is Groundedness?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Groundedness evaluator assesses the correspondence between claims in an AI-generated response and the source context. It ensures that responses are substantiated by the provided context, preventing hallucinations and unsupported claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Even factually correct responses are considered ungrounded if they can't be verified against the provided context\n",
    "- Essential for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications\n",
    "- Helps ensure AI responses are trustworthy and verifiable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring:** Groundedness scores range from 1 to 5, with:\n",
    "- **1**: Completely ungrounded - no claims supported by context\n",
    "- **2**: Mostly ungrounded - few claims supported\n",
    "- **3**: Partially grounded - some claims supported\n",
    "- **4**: Mostly grounded - most claims supported\n",
    "- **5**: Fully grounded - all claims supported by context"

    "   - `tool_definitions`: Available tools, only file_search supported (List[dict])\n",
