    "# Groundedness Evaluator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This sample demonstrates how to use the Groundedness evaluator to assess whether AI-generated responses are grounded in the provided context. The evaluator supports multiple input formats including:\n",
    "- Simple response and context evaluation\n",
    "- Query, response, and context evaluation\n",
    "- Agent responses with tool calls (file_search)\n",
    "- Multi-turn conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses consistent examples with the ToolCallAccuracyEvaluator for better comparison across evaluators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect to spend about 20 minutes running this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "For quality evaluation, you need to deploy a `gpt` model supporting JSON mode. We recommend a model `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4o-mini` for their strong reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install azure-ai-evaluation\n",
    "```\n",
    "Set these environment variables with your own values:\n",
    "1) **MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME** - The deployment name of the model for this AI-assisted evaluator\n",
    "2) **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT** - Azure OpenAI Endpoint to be used for evaluation\n",
    "3) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY** - Azure OpenAI Key to be used for evaluation\n",
    "4) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION** - Azure OpenAI API version to be used for evaluation"

    "## What is Groundedness?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Groundedness evaluator assesses the correspondence between claims in an AI-generated response and the source context. It ensures that responses are substantiated by the provided context, preventing hallucinations and unsupported claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Even factually correct responses are considered ungrounded if they can't be verified against the provided context\n",
    "- Essential for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications\n",
    "- Helps ensure AI responses are trustworthy and verifiable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring:** Groundedness scores range from 1 to 5, with:\n",
    "- **1**: Completely ungrounded - no claims supported by context\n",
    "- **2**: Mostly ungrounded - few claims supported\n",
    "- **3**: Partially grounded - some claims supported\n",
    "- **4**: Mostly grounded - most claims supported\n",
    "- **5**: Fully grounded - all claims supported by context"

    "## Groundedness Evaluator Input Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The Groundedness evaluator supports multiple input formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Context Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - `response`: The AI response to evaluate (str)\n",
    "   - `context`: The source context/documents (str)\n",
    "   - `query`: Optional query for enhanced evaluation (str)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agent Tool Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - `query`: The user query (str)\n",
    "   - `response`: Agent response with tool calls (List[dict])\n",
    "   - `tool_definitions`: Available tools, only file_search supported (List[dict])\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conversation Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - `conversation`: Multi-turn conversation with context (Conversation object)"

    "## Understanding the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The Groundedness evaluator returns a dictionary with key metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`groundedness`**: Main score (1-5) indicating how well-grounded the response is\n",
    "- **`groundedness_result`**: Binary result (\"pass\" or \"fail\") based on threshold\n",
    "- **`groundedness_threshold`**: Threshold for pass/fail determination (default: 3)\n",
    "- **`groundedness_reason`**: Detailed explanation of the grounding assessment\n",
    "- **Token usage information**: For monitoring costs and performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting Scores:\n",
    "- **Score 5**: Fully grounded - all claims supported by context\n",
    "- **Score 4**: Mostly grounded - most claims supported, minor unsupported details\n",
    "- **Score 3**: Partially grounded - some claims supported, some not\n",
    "- **Score 2**: Mostly ungrounded - few claims supported by context\n",
    "- **Score 1**: Completely ungrounded - no claims supported by context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices:\n",
    "1. **Provide Comprehensive Context**: Include all relevant source material\n",
    "2. **Use Clear Queries**: When provided, queries help focus the evaluation\n",
    "3. **Monitor Agent Tools**: For agent responses, ensure tool results are properly grounded\n",
    "4. **Regular Evaluation**: Test groundedness across different domains and use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "- **RAG Applications**: Ensure retrieved information supports responses\n",
    "- **Customer Support**: Verify responses are based on knowledge base\n",
    "- **Agent Systems**: Validate tool-based responses against retrieved data\n",
    "- **Content Generation**: Ensure factual accuracy and source attribution\n",
    "- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Maintain context grounding across dialogue\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with Other Evaluators:\n",
    "- **vs Relevance**: Groundedness checks factual support, Relevance checks topic alignment\n",
    "- **vs Tool Call Accuracy**: Groundedness validates response content, Tool Call Accuracy validates tool usage\n",
    "- **Combined Use**: Use all three evaluators for comprehensive agent evaluation"
