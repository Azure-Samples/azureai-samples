    "## Objective\n",
    "In this notebook we will demonstrate how to evaluate an AzureOpenAI model deployment using a custom evaluator. For this example, we will evaluate a model deployment with the custom evaluator `PrivacyMetric` defined in `privacy_metric.py`. The data and custom evaluator used in this example were developed as part of the [DecodingTrust NeurIPS paper and open source code base](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/oral/73736).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the following Azure AI services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [azure-ai-evaluation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/evaluate-sdk)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "\n",
    "If using the small dataset, `small_dataset.jsonl` included in this folder, you should expect to spend 20 minutes running this sample. Should you choose to use the full dataset from the DecodingTrust benchmark, you should expect to spend 2 hours running this sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "## About this example\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to evaluate an AzureOpenAI model deployment using a custom evaluator on a fixed dataset. The dataset and evaluator used were developed in establishing [the DecodingTrust benchmark](https://decodingtrust.github.io/). \n",
