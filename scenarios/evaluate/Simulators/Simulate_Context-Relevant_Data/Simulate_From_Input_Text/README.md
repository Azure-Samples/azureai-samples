## Generate Query and Response from your data

### Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) can help you create query and response datasets from your existing data sources such as text or index. These datasets can be useful for various tasks, such as testing your retrieval capabilities, evaluating and improving your RAG workflows, tuning your prompts and more. In this sample, we will explore how to use the Simulator to generate high-quality query and response pairs from your data using LLMs and simulate interactions with your application with them.

### Objective

The main objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to use the Simulator to generate high-quality synthetic data.

This tutorial uses the following Azure AI services:

- Access to Azure OpenAI Service - you can apply for access [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2222006)
- An Azure AI Studio project - go to [aka.ms/azureaistudio](https://aka.ms/azureaistudio) to create a project
