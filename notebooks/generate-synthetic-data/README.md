# Generate Questions and Answers from your data

Large Language Models (LLMs) can help you create question and answer datasets from your existing data sources. These datasets can be useful for various tasks, such as testing your LLM's retrieval capabilities, evaluating and improving your RAG workflows, tuning your prompts and more. In this sample, we will explore how to use the QADataGenerator to generate high-quality questions and answers from your data using LLMs.

This sample will be useful to developers and for data scientists who need data for developing RAG workflows or evaluating and improving RAG workflows.
