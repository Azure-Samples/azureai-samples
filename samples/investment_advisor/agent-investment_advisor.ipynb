    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a practical use case where an AI Agent is leveraged to gain actionable insights and address key analytical questions related to managing an investment portfolio. It combines data fetching, computation, and visualization to streamline decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario utilizes an AI Agent integrated with two powerful tools: Function Calling and Code Interpreter. These tools work together to retrieve stock prices and calculate portfolio metrics, replicating real-world workflows in investment management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Upload Investment Data*: Import a CSV file containing the user’s investment portfolio into the OpenAI Project.\n",
    "2. *Fetch Real-Time Stock Prices*: Use the Yahoo! Finance API via *Function Calling* to retrieve up-to-date closing stock data.\n",
    "3. *Perform Portfolio Analysis*: Leverage *Code Interpreter* to compute key portfolio metrics and insights.\n",
    "4. *Create Data Visualations*: Leverage *Color Interpreter* to generate portfolio visualization, and leverage Python libraries to render image."
