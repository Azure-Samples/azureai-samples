    "This notebook demonstrates a practical use case where an AI Assistant is leveraged to gain actionable insights and address key analytical questions related to managing an investment portfolio. It combines real-time data fetching, computation, and visualization to streamline decision-making.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. *Upload Investment Data*: Import a CSV file containing the user’s investment portfolio into the notebook.\n",
    "2. *Fetch Real-Time Stock Prices*: Use the Yahoo! Finance API via *Function Calling* to retrieve up-to-date stock data.\n",
