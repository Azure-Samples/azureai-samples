Welcome to the Azure AI Samples repository!

This repository acts as the top-level directory for official Azure AI sample code and examples. It includes notebooks and sample code that contain end-to-end samples as well as smaller code snippets for common developer tasks.

This repository is entirely open source, guidance on how to contribute and links to additional repositories are provided below.

Use the samples in this repository to try out Azure AI scenarios on your local machine!

This repository also serves as a hub for the Azure AI developer community. [Here](official-ai-resources-list.md) you can find a curated list of the official Microsoft SDKs, Samples and other guidance around Azure OpenAI and other Cognitive Services. For Python-specific list, see [here](official-ai-resources-list-python.md).
