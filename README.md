## What is the Azure AI Agent Service?

Azure AI Agent Service is a fully-managed service designed to empower developers to securely build, deploy, and scale high-quality, extensible AI agents. Leveraging an extensive ecosystem of models, tools, and capabilities from OpenAI, Microsoft, and third-party providers, Azure AI Agent Service enables building agents for a wide range of generative AI use cases.

## Highlights

- Bring your own Azure Storage Account
- Bring your own VNET (coming soon)
- Keyless setup and authentication
- No public egress
- Built-in conversation state management
- On-behalf-of authentication support for agents (coming soon)
- Monitor agent performance with OpenTelemetry-based tracing (coming soon)
- Build responsibly with content filters and XPIA (Cross Prompt Injection Attack) mitigation

### Rapid development and automation

Quickly build enterprise-grade AI agents with a user-friendly interface and comprehensive toolset, including:

- Pre-built tools for advanced data analysis and RAG
- Integration with Azure Logic Apps (1400+ built-in connectors)
- Custom tools with OpenAPI 3.0 specifications (managed identity support)
- Stateless or stateful code-based actions with Azure Functions (coming soon)
